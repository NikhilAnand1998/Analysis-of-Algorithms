**Files Uploaded: stoogesort.cpp and README.md
**Instructions: The stoogesort.cpp file sorts the data from data.txt with the first number in the line being the size of the array, and the rest of the values being used to fill
** the array. The file then outputs the sorted data from data.txt to an output file called stooge.out to compile the file first run ("g++ stoogesort.cpp") followed by
** ("./a.out") to execute the file. Then you can check stooge.out to verify that the sorting algorithm worked.
