**Files Uploaded: change.cpp, change.txt, changeTime.cpp,amount.txt, README.md
**Instructions: The change.cpp is the main file that will be executed, it takes in an input from a text file called, amount.txt and writes the output of the program
** to a file called change.txt. The code prints the output in the format of coin denominations, followed by Value you are trying to find the change of, how many of each coin is used
** and finally the minimum number of coins required to make change for the value. The changeTime.cpp is currently in the format where it will change both n and A from 1000 to 15000 and print ** the time it takes in milliseconds to execute the algorithm.
